# angular-bubble-graph
Allow to make a bubble chart with some options.

You can still easily extract logic from angular directive wrapping if you don't want to use the framework.

For Canvas example, see : https://jsfiddle.net/Arlisaha/h1amkaf8/41/

For SVG example, see : https://jsfiddle.net/Arlisaha/24f18zqv/41/ (still in progress ! Lacks of tooltips)

Events 'bubble_clicked' in angular and DOM are dispatched directly from SVG/canvas element.
